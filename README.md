# Kanak - A Finance Manager for your personal finances

Kanak is a personal project. It is being built for me, but it may end up useful for you. 

## Why?

Health and finances are two items that are critical to our lives yet we understand very little of.
I can't do anything about health, but I wanted to see if I can do something about my own finances.
It is a smaller problem, but I wanted to solve it for myself.


I loved Kubera [^kubera], I really liked it, but it met only part of my requirement, what
I wanted was an app that combined both wealth tracking and an expense manager. While
I came across many wonderful solutions for expense tracking too and currently use
Home Budget [^home_budget] on my phone to track my expenses, but again want a single application,
that will eventually work across desktop, web and mobile. Also none of these took into consideration
some other factors that I was interested in, for example, tracking how my investments were doing net
of all costs was something that was surprisingly hard to do. 


## What?

Kanak is a personal finance manager, that is specifically being designed for me. It tries to 
combine the various aspects of finance management that we need in our lives. 


All companies have a finance officer or in fact a finance team, everyone could use a bit of a finance 
manager for our personal finance. 


There are three large aspects to managing your finance
